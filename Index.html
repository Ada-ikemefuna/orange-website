          <h3>Food</h3>
          <p>It's no gainsaying that food is one of the keys for mere human survival. So i hope you're not surprised it pioneers the
             list of my top favorite things to do. And by favorite thing to do i'm definitely talking about eating food and not cooking it.</p>

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>I don't know to explain it to you but when my life turns to shit i turn to music. it does make me feel better amd i know a lot
          of people feel this way too. i won't sing to save my own life though so i'm glad someone else can.</p>

          <h3>Sleep</h3>
          <p>To be honest i don't even have a proper sleeping pattern, i freestyle this shit. i dont know if it's a good thing or not
          but i know it does feel good. I still need a scientific explanation as to why i sleep for rest and still wake up tired though.</p>
